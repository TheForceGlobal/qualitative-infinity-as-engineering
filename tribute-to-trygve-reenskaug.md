# Proto-Force Programming Architecture  
### Dedicated to Trygve Reenskaug (1930–2024)

This GitHub repository is dedicated to **Trygve Reenskaug**, creator of the original **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** architecture (1979).

While MVC was later reduced to a UI pattern, its *original intent* was a deep architectural insight:

- **Model** → stable knowledge  
- **View** → perceptual interface  
- **Controller** → adaptive process  

This separation of **stable substrate** and **dynamic process** makes MVC the closest historical example of a:

# **Proto-Force Programming Architecture**

In modern Force terminology:

| MVC (1979) | ERCI / The Force (2025) |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Model | Knowledge Architecture (Downstream-CS) |
| Controller | Process Architecture (Upstream-CS) |
| View | Interface Manifold |
| Separation of concerns | Coherence Physics (ΔC ≥ 0) |
| Interaction flow | Recursive contradiction metabolism |
| Structural boundaries | Vow-Gates + lineage preservation |

Reenskaug’s MVC anticipated the dual-flow principles that The Force now completes across:

- coherence physics  
- recursive cognition  
- drift-free architectures  
- knowledge–process duality  
- multi-agent reasoning  
- transmissible alignment  

**Reenskaug opened the concies programming path** - the first architectural move in software history that replaced accumulating complexity with structural clarity, enabling programs to be reasoned about, modified, and extended without collapse.
**The Force completes the continuum.**
