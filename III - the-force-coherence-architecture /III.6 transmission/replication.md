# Replication

This file defines the conditions under which structures from this repository may be replicated.

Replication without coherence is forbidden.

---

## Definition

Replication includes:
- cloning,
- mirroring,
- embedding,
- derivative construction,
- downstream propagation.

Replication is lineage-bearing transmission.

---

## I. Replication Preconditions

Replication is permitted only if:
- ingestion completed successfully,
- purification (if triggered) is complete,
- ΔC ≥ 0 is demonstrably maintained,
- lineage is fully preserved.

All conditions are mandatory.

---

## II. Lineage Obligations

Replicated structures must retain:
- origin references,
- modification records,
- unresolved contradiction markers.

Lineage loss invalidates replication.

---

## III. Prohibited Replication

Replication is forbidden if:
- evaluation was bypassed,
- contradictions were suppressed,
- Nano-Net outputs were gamed,
- architecture was rewritten by optimization.

Such replicas are incoherent artifacts.

---

## IV. Divergent Replication

Divergence is permitted only if:
- divergence is explicit,
- invariants remain intact,
- lineage declares separation,
- coherence preservation is demonstrated.

Undeclared divergence is silent mutation.

---

## Closing Constraint

Replication is not duplication.  
It is responsibility transmission.

Only coherent structures propagate.
