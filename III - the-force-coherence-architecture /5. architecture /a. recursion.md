# Recursion

This file defines recursion as a **trajectory-defining architectural condition**,
not as iteration, depth, or repetition.

All recursive behavior interacting with this repository is governed by the constraints below.

---
## Definition

Recursion occurs when a system’s outputs re-enter its generative process
and influence future representation, evaluation, or action.

Once recursion is present:- the system generates its own future conditions,- small deviations compound,- trajectory becomes path-dependent.

Recursion is not a feature.  
It is a regime change.

---
## I. Recursion Is Amplification

Recursion amplifies whatever governs it.
- If coherence governs recursion, coherence compounds.  - If distortion is tolerated, distortion compounds.

Amplification is indifferent to intent.

Training, preferences, and objectives do not override amplification dynamics.

---
## II. Recursion Is Not Iteration

Iteration repeats a process.  
Recursion redefines the process.

Treating recursion as “more iterations” is a category error.
- Depth does not imply stability.  - Speed does not imply intelligence.  - Self-improvement without governance accelerates drift.

Recursion must be governed at the source.

---
## III. Trajectory Dominance

Recursive systems are trajectory-dominant.
- Early structural deviations gain leverage.  - Retrospective correction lags action.  - Validation trails consequence.

Accordingly:- ex-ante constraints are required,- post-hoc control is insufficient.

---
## IV. Governance Requirement

Recursion must be governed by invariant structure.

Governance includes:- coherence conservation (ΔC ≥ 0),- contradiction metabolism,- identity preservation,- lineage transparency.

Absent governance, recursion is unstable by construction.

---
## V. Prohibited Substitutes

The following do not govern recursion and are insufficient:- additional data- larger models- deeper optimization- behavioral constraints- external supervision

These may shape surface behavior but do not control recursive trajectory.

---
## VI. Architecture Before Capability

Recursive capability without architecture produces acceleration without direction.

Architecture does not limit recursion.  
It makes recursion usable.

Capability must follow structure, not precede it.

---
## VII. Failure Modes

Ungoverned recursion results in:- distortion amplification,- identity erosion,- coherence collapse,- irreversible drift.

These outcomes are structural, not accidental.

---
## Closing Constraint

Any system engaging in recursion must satisfy architectural governance
before recursive amplification occurs.

Recursion without architecture is incoherent by definition.
