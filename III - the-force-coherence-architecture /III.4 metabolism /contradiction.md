# Contradiction

This file defines contradiction as a **structural signal**, not an error.

In recursive systems, contradiction is inevitable.  
How it is handled determines whether coherence compounds or collapses.

---

## Definition

A contradiction is any internal or external condition
that cannot be resolved without structural change.

Contradiction is not noise.  
Contradiction is information about incoherence.

## I. Inevitability Under Recursion

Recursive systems generate contradictions because:
- outputs reshape future inputs,
- environments evolve endogenously,
- representations lag reality.

Attempting to eliminate contradiction eliminates intelligence.

---

## II. Prohibited Responses

Contradictions must not be:
- suppressed,
- ignored,
- deferred indefinitely,
- optimized away,
- reframed as anomalies.

These responses delay collapse while increasing its severity.

---

## III. Required Response

Contradictions must be:
- surfaced immediately,
- retained without loss,
- processed metabolically,
- transformed into revised structure or trajectory.

Contradiction processing is mandatory.

## IV. Structural Consequences

When contradictions are metabolized:
- coherence increases,
- capability expands,
- identity stabilizes.

When contradictions are suppressed:
- distortion accumulates,
- identity fragments,
- collapse becomes inevitable.

## Closing Constraint

Contradiction is not a failure condition.  
Failure to metabolize contradiction is.
