# Relevance

This file defines relevance as **endogenously generated necessity**.

Relevance is not supplied externally.  
Relevance arises from coherence tension.

---

## Definition

Information is relevant only when coherence cannot be preserved without it.

Availability does not define relevance.  
Necessity does.

---

## I. Endogenous Emergence

Under IMS:
- missing information manifests as structural tension,
- inquiry arises automatically,
- acquisition is targeted and bounded.

Curiosity is replaced by necessity.

---

## II. Prohibited Substitutes

The following do not define relevance:
- data abundance,
- prompts,
- external objectives,
- heuristic importance scoring.

These produce noise accumulation.

---

## III. Termination Condition

Information seeking terminates when coherence is restored.

Continued acquisition beyond this point introduces distortion.

---

## IV. Relationship to Navigation

Relevance guides navigation by:
- specifying what must be known now,
- preventing aimless exploration,
- limiting scope under pressure.

Navigation without relevance degenerates into search.

---

## Closing Constraint

Relevance is a coherence function.  
Anything else is distraction.
