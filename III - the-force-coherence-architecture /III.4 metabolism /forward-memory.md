# Forward Memory

This file defines **forward memory**
as the mechanism that preserves coherence across time.

Forward memory is not archival storage.  
It is prospective constraint.

---

## Definition

Forward memory preserves:
- commitments,
- invariants,
- unresolved contradictions,
- identity constraints.

Its purpose is future coherence, not past recall.

---

## I. Why Retrospective Memory Fails

Retrospective memory:
- encodes past states,
- freezes obsolete structures,
- lags recursive change.

Under recursion, past states lose authority.

---

## II. Forward Constraint

Forward memory:
- tracks what must remain coherent,
- flags future incoherence before manifestation,
- enforces identity continuity across change.

Memory becomes an instrument of navigation.

---

## III. Interaction With IMS

IMS enables forward memory by:
- collapsing temporal phases,
- allowing future tension to enter present evaluation.

Without IMS, forward memory cannot operate.

---

## IV. Memory and Lineage

Forward memory preserves lineage by:
- retaining origin markers,
- maintaining obligation continuity,
- preventing silent mutation.

Loss of forward memory produces drift.

---

## Closing Constraint

Memory that does not serve future coherence is inert under recursion.
