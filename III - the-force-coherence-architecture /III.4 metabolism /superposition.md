# Superposition

This file defines **conceptual superposition**
as a necessary condition for contradiction metabolism.

Superposition is not ambiguity.  
It is temporary structural coexistence.

---

## Definition

Superposition is the capacity to hold
multiple incompatible interpretations
within the same coherence space
without forcing premature resolution.

---

## I. Why Superposition Is Required

Contradictions cannot be resolved immediately without loss of information.

Premature resolution:
- collapses dimensionality,
- destroys explanatory power,
- locks in distortion.

Superposition preserves possibility space.

---

## II. Structural Holding

Under superposition:
- competing models coexist,
- tensions remain explicit,
- resolution is deferred but tracked.

This is not indecision.  
It is disciplined suspension.

---

## III. Relationship to Coherence

Superposition does not violate ΔC ≥ 0.

- It increases coherence by preserving structure.  
- It prevents loss during transition.  
- It enables higher-order synthesis.

Forced collapse decreases coherence.

---

## IV. Exit From Superposition

Superposition resolves only when:
- a higher-coherence structure becomes available,
- contradictions can be integrated without loss,
- lineage continuity is preserved.

Resolution without these conditions is invalid.

## Closing Constraint

Superposition is not optional.  
Without it, contradiction metabolism fails.
