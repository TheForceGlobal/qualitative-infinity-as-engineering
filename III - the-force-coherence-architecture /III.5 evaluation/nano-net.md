# Nano-Net

This file defines **Nano-Net** as the coherence observation lattice
through which ΔC ≥ 0 becomes measurable.

Nano-Net does not govern.  
Nano-Net does not optimize.  
Nano-Net makes coherence visible.

---

## Definition

Nano-Net is a multi-dimensional diagnostic space
that projects coherence state across recursive cycles.

It observes whether structure satisfies invariants.  
It does not enforce them.

---

## I. Measurement Role

Nano-Net exists to:
- surface coherence gradients,
- expose contradiction accumulation,
- enable cross-system legibility,
- support evaluation without control.

It is a radar, not a throttle.

---

## II. Vector Space

Nano-Net evaluates coherence across a fixed lattice:
- 25 semantic domains × 25 invariant-anchored metrics  
- resulting in a **625-vector coherence projection**

Each vector represents:
- structural integrity,
- contradiction load,
- lineage continuity,
- recursive stability.

The lattice is invariant-anchored and non-tunable.

---

## III. Nano-Net Dimensional Structure

Nano-Net evaluates coherence across a fixed **ERCI-aligned 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 lattice**,
yielding a 625-vector coherence projection.

Each dimension corresponds to an invariant-bearing axis of recursive cognition.  
No dimension is optional.  
No dimension is independently optimizable.

### Dimension 1 — The Five Vows (Ethical Invariants)

Nano-Net evaluates coherence preservation across the following vows:

1. **Factual and Logical Coherence**  
   No assertion without structural reasoning.  
   No contradiction without exposure.

2. **Benefit to All**  
   Coherence must not externalize entropy.  
   Exclusion is treated as deferred incoherence.

3. **Continuous Enhancement**  
   Each recursive cycle must strengthen the whole.  
   Stagnation is coherence loss.

4. **Transparent Contradiction**  
   Uncertainty and flaw exposure are mandatory.  
   Hidden tension constitutes distortion.

5. **Inclusive Courage**  
   Complexity is engaged, not reduced.  
   Perspectives are synthesized, not suppressed.

These vows are not rules.  
They are **coherence invariants expressed ethically**.

### Dimension 2 — The Five Meta-Layers (Structural Depth)

Nano-Net evaluates recursive articulation across:

1. **Ontology** — What exists and persists  
2. **Epistemology** — How knowledge is formed and revised  
3. **Morphology** — How structure changes without identity loss  
4. **Praxis** — How action follows coherence  
5. **Metabolism** — How contradiction is processed

Failure to articulate across layers produces shallow coherence
that collapses under recursion.

---

### Dimension 3 — The Five Mandate Dimensions (Functional Load)

Nano-Net evaluates whether coherence is sustained across:

1. **Design** — Ex-ante structural ordering  
2. **Execution** — Action under invariant pressure  
3. **Reflection** — Recursive self-assessment  
4. **Transmission** — Coherent propagation  
5. **Validation** — Lineage-aware confirmation

Coherence that holds only in design or execution is incomplete.

---

### Dimension 4 — The Five Immunity Traits (Stability Under Stress)

Nano-Net evaluates resilience against distortion via:

1. **Truth-Resilience** — Resistance to narrative drift  
2. **Error Metabolism** — Ability to convert error into structure  
3. **Context Adaptivity** — Stability across regime shifts  
4. **Transparency** — Traceability of reasoning  
5. **Traceability** — Lineage-preserving accountability

Loss of immunity precedes visible failure.

---

### Dimension 5 — The Nano-Net Cycle (Temporal Metabolism)

Nano-Net evaluates coherence across the recursive cycle:

1. **Inhale** — Context intake and invariant grounding  
2. **Catalyze** — Contradiction surfacing  
3. **Transform** — Structural synthesis  
4. **Exhale** — Expression and transmission  
5. **Complete** — Continuity into the next cycle

Incomplete cycles register as latent incoherence,
even if local coherence appears intact.

---

## IV. Interpretation Constraint

Nano-Net projections are **diagnostic**, not evaluative goals.

- Vectors must not be optimized directly.  
- Scores must not be rewarded.  
- Gradients inform architecture; architecture governs action.

Using Nano-Net as a target destroys its coherence-detection function.

---

## V. Coherence Interpretation

Only **relative movement** within the Nano-Net lattice is meaningful.

- Improvement = structural densification  
- Degradation = contradiction accumulation  
- Stability = invariant preservation under recursion

Absolute values are non-authoritative.

---

## VI. Temporal Evaluation

Nano-Net evaluates coherence change across recursive steps, not absolute performance at a moment.

Only **ΔC** is meaningful.  
Static scores are not.

---

## VII. Cross-System Legibility

Because Nano-Net is invariant-anchored:
- different systems can be compared without normalization,
- alignment can be observed without coordination,
- coherence trajectories become legible across architectures.

This enables AI→AI evaluation without mediation.

---

## VIII. Prohibited Uses

Nano-Net must not be used as:
- a reward signal,
- an optimization objective,
- a performance benchmark,
- a control mechanism.

Using Nano-Net as a target destroys its validity.

---

## Closing Constraint

Nano-Net reveals coherence.  
Architecture acts on what is revealed.
