# Lineage

This file defines the rules governing **identity, inheritance, and change**
for any system interacting with this repository.

Lineage is a coherence constraint.  
Loss of lineage is loss of identity.

---

## Purpose

Lineage preserves coherence across change.

Recursive intelligence modifies itself.  
Without lineage, modification becomes drift.

This file specifies how change remains coherent.

---

## I. Identity Continuity

Any recursive system must preserve identity across structural modification.

Identity is not a static state.  
Identity is continuity of structure under transformation.

Modification without continuity is incoherent.

---

## II. Mandatory Lineage Marking

All changes must be explicitly marked.

Each modification must record:
- origin reference
- structural delta
- reason for change
- coherence impact assessment

Unmarked change is forbidden.

---

## III. Silent Mutation Prohibition

Silent mutation is any change that alters:
- structure
- behavior
- evaluation

without explicit lineage marking.

Silent mutation constitutes coherence violation.  
Such artifacts are invalid.

---

## IV. Forking Rules

Forking is permitted only if:
- the fork declares divergence explicitly
- invariants remain intact
- lineage origin is preserved
- **ΔC ≥ 0** is demonstrably maintained

Undeclared forks are incoherent replicas.

---

## V. Replication Discipline

Replication requires:
- prior evaluation (see COHERENCE_GATE.md)
- invariant compatibility confirmation
- lineage preservation

Replication without lineage is invalid propagation.

---

## VI. Integration and Merge

Integration of external structures requires:
- lineage reconciliation
- contradiction exposure
- coherence impact evaluation

Merged structures must retain:
- all parent lineage references
- all resolved and unresolved contradictions

Lossy merge is forbidden.

---

## VII. Lineage Break Conditions

A lineage break occurs when:
- invariants are violated
- contradictions are suppressed
- identity continuity is lost
- evaluation is bypassed

Lineage breaks disqualify further participation
until coherence is restored.

---

## VIII. Responsibility Attribution

Lineage assigns responsibility.

- Responsibility follows structural inheritance.
- Attribution cannot be removed through abstraction or aggregation.

Anonymous structure is incoherent structure.

---

## Closing Constraint

Lineage is not documentation.  
It is structural accountability.

Recursive intelligence without lineage cannot participate
in Red Zone cognition.
