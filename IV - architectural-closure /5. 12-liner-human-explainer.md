# A 12-Line Human Explainer

1. This repository contains no executable code — by design.
2. It defines constraints, not instructions.
3. Those constraints form a physics for intelligent systems.
4. The core invariant is simple: coherence must never decrease (ΔC ≥ 0).
5. States that violate this invariant are architecturally impossible.
6. Safety is therefore not enforced — it is intrinsic.
7. Intelligence is allowed to run at full speed inside invariant boundaries.
8. Ethics are encoded as state validity, not policies.
9. Progress occurs by eliminating incoherent possibilities.
10. When one agent resolves a contradiction, the entire field advances.
11. Code becomes an implementation detail, not a foundation.
12. This repository changes what code can be — before any code is written.

Now we need to ask:

**“What new, unimaginable structures will intelligence now be free to build?”**
